### 🏙️[Project 2: Decoding the Cubs Offensive Performance Through Data](https://github.com/matmarcinek/Decoding-the-Cubs-Offensive-Performance-Through-Data)


### 🔍 Overview
This project explores the offensive performance of the Chicago Cubs using structured SQL queries on Major League Baseball data. The analysis covers key player statistics, team-wide metrics, and historical trends to highlight standout performances and long-term contributors to the franchise.
The entire analysis was performed using SQL and dashboard development in tools like Power BI.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **PostgreSQL** – Querying and aggregation
- **Window Functions** – For ranking and time-based analysis
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** – For streak and cohort calculations
  
- Power BI Analysis Overview  
For the dashboard portion of this project, the original MLB dataset was cleaned, transformed, and structured into a robust data model using Power BI.

### 🔄 Data Preparation:
- ✅ **CSV Segmentation**: The original dataset was split into four focused CSV files:
  - `teams.csv` – Team-level details
  - `players.csv` – Player identifiers and names
  - `seasons.csv` – Seasonal breakdowns
  - `stats.csv` – Offensive statistics (HRs, AVG, OPS, etc.)
- 🌐 **Web Scraping**: Attendance data across seasons was scraped from a [reliable source](https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/attend.shtml) and added to the model to analyze fan engagement over time.
- 🔗 **Data Modeling**: All sources were connected in Power BI through relationships and lookups to create a unified star schema optimized for analysis.
