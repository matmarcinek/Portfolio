### 🏙️[Project 1: AirBnb New York Market Analysis](https://github.com/matmarcinek/AirBnb)

A concise data analysis project exploring Airbnb listings in New York City using Python and Tableau.

### 🔍 Overview
- Analyzed Airbnb data with **Python** (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Visualized key trends using **Tableau**
- Explored **pricing**, **room types**, and **neighborhood distributions**

### 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** – Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Tableau Desktop**


### 🏙️[Project 2: Decoding the Cubs Offensive Performance Through Data](https://github.com/matmarcinek/Decoding-the-Cubs-Offensive-Performance-Through-Data)


### 🔍 Overview
This project explores the offensive performance of the Chicago Cubs using **PostgreSQL** queries on Major League Baseball data. The analysis covers key player statistics, team-wide metrics, and historical trends to highlight standout performances and long-term contributors to the franchise.
The entire analysis was performed using SQL and dashboard development in tools like **Power BI**  .

### 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **PostgreSQL** – Querying and aggregation
- **Window Functions** – For ranking and time-based analysis
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** – For streak and cohort calculations
  
- **Power BI** Analysis Overview  
For the dashboard portion of this project, the original MLB dataset was cleaned, transformed, and structured into a robust data model.

### 🔄 Data Preparation:
- ✅ **CSV Segmentation**: The original dataset was split into four focused CSV files:
  - `teams.csv` – Team-level details
  - `players.csv` – Player identifiers and names
  - `seasons.csv` – Seasonal breakdowns
  - `stats.csv` – Offensive statistics (HRs, AVG, OPS, etc.)
- 🌐 **Web Scraping**: Attendance data across seasons was scraped from a [reliable source](https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/attend.shtml) and added to the model to analyze fan engagement over time.
- 🔗 **Data Modeling**: All sources were connected in Power BI through relationships and lookups to create a unified star schema optimized for analysis.


### 🫀 [Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning](https://github.com/matmarcinek/Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning)

### 🔍 Problem Statement
The objective is to predict whether a patient has heart disease (binary classification) using features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other clinical data.


### 🧾 Dataset
Source: Kaggle – Heart Disease Classification Dataset

Attributes used: 14 (including age, sex, cp, chol, thalach, etc.)

Target: 1 indicates presence of heart disease, 0 indicates absence
